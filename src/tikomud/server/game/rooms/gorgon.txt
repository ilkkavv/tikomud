It's pitch black.
You hear nothing at first -
only the heavy silence
pressing against your eardrums
and the distant drip... drip...
of water falling somewhere far below.

You fumble for your torch.
A spark. Then another.
Finally, a trembling flame blossoms.

As your vision clears,
your breath catches in your throat.

The walls are covered in faces.
Not carved.
Not sculpted.
Pressed into the stone
as if the rock itself tried to remember them.

Eyes frozen mid-sob.
Mouths streched in silent screams.
Every expression a different moment
of agony,
captured forever.

A cold shiver crawls down your spine.
You wonder what kind of place this is -
and what kind of thing could do this.

Then, from somewhere in the darkness,
a laught echoes.
Low. Wet.
Wrong.

You turn, heart pounding,
trying to pinpoint
where the sound
is coming from...
