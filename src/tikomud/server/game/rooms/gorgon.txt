It's pitch black.
You hear nothing at first -
only the heavy silence
pressing against your eardrums
and the distant drip... drip...
of water falling somewhere far below.

You fumble for your torch.
A spark. Then another.
Finally, a trembling flame blossoms.

As your vision clears,
your breath catches in your throat.

The walls are covered in faces.
Not carved.
Not sculpted.
Pressed into the stone
as if the rock itself tried to remember them.

Eyes frozen mid-sob.
Mouths streched in silent screams.
Every expression a different moment
of agony,
captured forever.

A cold shiver crawls down your spine.
You wonder what kind of place this is -
and what kind of thing could do this.

Then, from somewhere in the darkness,
a laught echoes.
Low. Wet.
Wrong.

You turn, heart pounding,
trying to pinpoint
where the sound
is coming from...

The laugther echoes again.
Closer this time.
Lower.
Like stone grinding against stone.

The torch flame shudders.
Shadows crawl across the walls
as if the carved faces are shifting -
their expressions changing
in the corner of your eye.

A faint rhythm pulses beneath the floor.
A heart.
But far too slow to be human.

You turn toward the sound.
A silhouette detaches from the darkness.
Tall.
Bent.
A figure held together by bone,
light,
and memory.

Eyes like fractured lanterns
open in the void.
And Khrýsa steps forward.

"Do you hear them?
The ones who came before you?"

A pause.

"Your heart...
still beats in the right shape.
How rare."

Khrýsa tilts her head,
as if listening to something you cannot hear.

"But even stone can envy flesh."

Khrýsa's fingers trail along the wall,
sinking into one of the stone faces
as thought it were wet clay.

"All these faces...
they used to be full of noise.
Hope... dread...
the tiny songs of being alive."

She presses deeper.
The wall shivers around her wrist.

"They asked me to remember them.
So I did.
And now I remember too much."

Her lantern-eyes lock onto yours.

"Let me lighten the burden,
little spark."

You've always felt something
wrong beneath your ribs -
a quiet crack no one else ever noticed.
And now, in this darkness,
it feels like the world finally sees it.
