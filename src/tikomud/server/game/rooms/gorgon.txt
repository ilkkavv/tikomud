It's pitch black.
You hear nothing at first -
only the heavy silence
pressing against your eardrums
and the distant drip... drip...
of water falling somewhere far below.

You fumble for your torch.
A spark. Then another.
Finally, a trembling flame blossoms.

As your vision clears,
your breath catches in your throat.

The walls are covered in faces.
Not carved.
Not sculpted.
Pressed into the stone
as if the rock itself tried to remember them.

Eyes frozen mid-sob.
Mouths streched in silent screams.
Every expression a different moment
of agony,
captured forever.

A cold shiver crawls down your spine.
You wonder what kind of place this is -
and what kind of thing could do this.

Then, from somewhere in the darkness,
a laught echoes.
Low. Wet.
Wrong.

You turn, heart pounding,
trying to pinpoint
where the sound
is coming from...

The laugther echoes again.
Closer this time.
Lower.
Like stone grinding against stone.

The torch flame shudders.
Shadows crawl across the walls
as if the carved faces are shifting -
their expressions changing
in the corner of your eye.

A faint rhythm pulses beneath the floor.
A heart.
But far too slow to be human.

You turn toward the sound.
A silhouette detaches from the darkness.
Tall.
Bent.
A figure held together by bone,
light,
and memory.

Eyes like fractured lanterns
open in the void.
And Khrýsa steps forward.

"Do you hear them?
The ones who came before you?"

A pause.

"Your heart...
still beats in the right shape.
How rare."

Khrýsa tilts her head,
as if listening to something you cannot hear.

"But even stone can envy flesh."

Khrýsa's fingers trail along the wall,
sinking into one of the stone faces
as thought it were wet clay.

"All these faces...
they used to be full of noise.
Hope... dread...
the tiny songs of being alive."

She presses deeper.
The wall shivers around her wrist.

"They asked me to remember them.
So I did.
And now I remember too much."

Her lantern-eyes lock onto yours.

"Let me lighten the burden,
little spark."

You've always felt something
wrong beneath your ribs -
a quiet crack no one else ever noticed.
And now, in this darkness,
it feels like the world finally sees it.

"Your heart is so pure"

Khrýsa whispers.
A voice like stone dust
sliding down a cavern wall.

"And that...
is your flaw."

Something cold brushes your chest.
Not her hand -
something deeper.
A presence.

Your limbs lock instantly.
Breath stalls in your throat.
The air around you turns brittle,
as if the darkness itself
is freezing solid.

A pressure builds behind your eyes.
A slow, grinding weight -
like two unseen hands
trying to pry open your mind.

Memories flicker.
Not yours.
Faces you've never seen.
Screams that end before they begin.

You try to speak.
Your jaw will not obey.
Tears spill down your cheeks,
warm against the spreading cold.

Your heartbeat falters.
One heavy thud.
Another.
Each weaker than the last.

Khrýsa leans closer.
Her lantern-eyes widen.

"Do you understand now?
All hearts break the same way."

Your vision tunnels.
Darkens.

A sound.
A soft, brittle crack behind you.
At first you think it's your joints
buckling under the cold.
But the noise comes again -
and again -
spreading across the walls
like a shiver.

The stone around you...
moves.
Very slow,
as if waking from a long,
aching sleep,
the faces in the wall twist.

Mouths pull back into single,
jagged grin.
Eyes you thought were carved
blink wetly open,
catching the torchlight
like dull, starving stars.

A wave of cold drives into your back -
the same cold Khrýsa forced into your chest -
and for a heartbeat you cannot tell
where your body ends
and the wall begins.

The the stone splits.
Hands push through the cracks -
too many, too thin,
too desperate -
reaching not to grap,
but to draw you in,
to fold you back
into their silent congregation.

A fresh spike of pain
lances through you skull.
Not just fear -
a memory
trying to replace your own.

Your knees weaken.
Your sking tightens.
Your breath becomes frost.

And at the edge of collapse -
A spark.
A whisper.
Not from her.
From you.
Something you had forgotten.
A word.
A gesture.
A fragment of power
buried deep within the noise.

A spell...
